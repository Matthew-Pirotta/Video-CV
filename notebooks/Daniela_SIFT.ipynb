    "\n",
    "- Hints for comparison: \n",
    "    - Number of detected features: How many keypoints does each algorithm detect in the same image? More keypoints are not always better, but a sufficient number is required for reliable matching. Students could create a plot of the number of features detected vs frame number. \n",
    "    - Matching performance: How many correct matches are found by each algorithm? This can be evaluated by visually inspecting a subset of the matches. Students could visualise the matches using a small number of image pairs (e.g., 5-10 pairs). \n",
    "    - Computational speed: How long does each algorithm take to detect and describe features? Students can use Python's time module to measure the execution time for this stage. \n",
    "    - Robustness to image transformations: How well do the algorithms perform under different conditions, such as changes in scale, rotation, illumination, and viewpoint? This can be done qualitatively by selecting image pairs with significant viewpoint changes and observing the number of matches. \n",
    "    - Qualitative assessment: How well do the features visually correspond between frames? Students can create a montage of a few frames, and the feature matches. \n",
    "-  Teams must explain the algorithms' parameters and justify their values. "
